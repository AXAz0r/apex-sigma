Routes: Walkthrough

As far as I can tell, absolutely nothing in the Mappie segments influences which of the five heroine routes you end up on (if any), not even the parts where one of the heroines accompanies you. So they're ignored in this section.

I don't try to list every single choice you should make for each route, because a lot of them probably don't matter. Instead I try to list only the important choices, the ones I think are enough to guarantee you get the route no matter what else you do.

I'll also point out bad ends, since why not.

Kotori:
10/3: Something She Likes
10/4: Eat With Kotori
10/6: It Doesn't Matter (to avoid Chihaya route)
10/7: I Can't Answer That
10/16: Follow Kotori
10/18: It's Not a Big Deal (to avoid Lucia route)
10/21: Take This Opportunity to Sleep (to avoid Lucia route)
10/23: Follow Her
10/25: Follow Kotori (choose Go Solo and Look for Chihaya instead to get a bad end on 10/31).

During Kotori's Route:
Only one choice, and it has only one option.

Chihaya:
10/5: Help Her Out
10/6: Follow Her, Save Her
10/7: I Can't Answer That, Braking
10/18: It's Not a Big Deal (to avoid Lucia route)
10/20: I Don't Like His Attitude, But I Want to See the Cat
10/21: Take This Opportunity to Sleep (to avoid Lucia route)
10/23: Watch Her Leave (to avoid Kotori route)
10/25: Go Solo and Look for Chihaya
11/3: I Don't Know
11/12: Save Chihaya

During Chihaya's Route:
Three choices, each with two options. For each choice, one option leads to an immediate bad end. The bad end options are "Dodge It", "Attack Tenma Directly" and "Strengthen Myself Anyway".

Lucia:
10/6: It Doesn't Matter (to avoid Chihaya route)
10/7: I Can't Answer That
10/9: The Classroom's Fine
10/16: Go to the Cafeteria
10/18: I Wanna Know...
10/21: Collaborate with Yoshino
10/23: I Have to Do Something

During Lucia's Route:
No choices.

Shizuru:
Unlock this route by completing Kotori's route.
10/6: It Doesn't Matter (to avoid Chihaya route)
10/7: Myself
10/18: Talk to Her, It's Not a Big Deal (to avoid Lucia route)
10/20: Go
10/21: Take This Opportunity to Sleep (to avoid Lucia route)
10/23: Watch Her Leave (to avoid Kotori route)
10/25: Go Check on Shizuru

If you want to get a lot of Friends and Quests done on your initial playthrough, consider following the instructions from "Playthrough 3" (in the next section). The only thing in there you won't be able to do is get the Legendary Sukumon (prereq for Friend #90), but missing just one Friend won't prevent you from unlocking anything later.

During Shizuru's Route:
One choice, two options. Choose "Keep Going As-Is" to get an immediate bad end.

Akane:
Unlock this route by completing Chihaya's route.
10/6: It Doesn't Matter (to avoid Chihaya route)
10/7: The World
10/16: Go Somewhere Else
10/18: It's Not a Big Deal (to avoid Lucia route)
10/21: Take This Opportunity to Sleep (to avoid Lucia route)
10/23: Watch Her Leave (to avoid Kotori route)
10/25: Stay Here

If you want to get a lot of Friends and Quests done on your initial playthrough, consider following the instructions from "Playthrough 4" (in the next section). The only thing in there you won't be able to do is read the Oppai Ending, but you can easily leave a save on 11/7 to help you get to that ending quickly once you can unlock it.

During Akane's Route:
No choices.

Moon:
Unlock this route by completing all five heroines' routes, then choose it from the main menu.
No choices.

Terra:
Unlock this route by completing Moon, then choose it from the main menu.
Several choices, though only one of them gives you multiple options that actually lead to different outcomes. On that one choice, you get a bad end unless you choose "Let It Go".

Oppai Ending:
Complete all quests, then complete Quest #28: "Proof of Paranormal Phenomena" and never choose "That's Enough".
For this reason, it's best to save Quest #28 for last (or leave a save file on 11/7 before completing it).

Friends and Quests: Walkthrough

This is meant to be a step-by-step guide to completing all quests and finding all friends within a reasonable number of playthroughs, so that you don't have to come up with a plan of you own based on the rather large amount of information in the lists below.

Playthrough 1

First, actually finish reading the entire VN. This completes Quest 31: "Rewrite".
This should be easy to do, but if you need help consult the "Routes: Walkthrough" section above.
Quests #2: "Tsuchinoko Sighting on Campus!?" and #8: "I Have Superpowers" are unavoidable, and 66 of the friends are unavoidable (counting all routes). You will get more quests and friends than that no matter what, but which additional ones is not predetermined. If you're curious, the unavoidable friends are: 1-26, 28-51, 58, 62-63, 81-82, 93, 96, 98-99, 101-106, and 108.

Playthrough 2

Second, complete Quest #29: "Spoiled end" by getting all bad ends, if you haven't already. You should be able to complete this without any help (see the "Routes: Walkthrough" section if you do need help), and it doesn't make much sense to try completing anything else alongside this, so get it out of the way now.

Playthrough 3

The goal here is to complete two multi-part quests (#23 and #26, which involve collecting porn books and planting seeds respectively) and a handful of friends (#64, #94 and #95) that we simply can't complete during the last playthrough. Completing quests #23 and #26 and getting friend #64 requires a Kotori-related Mappie segment, and friends #94 and #95 require a Shizuru-related scene, so we'll be going down both of their routes, kind of. I'll also throw in other random friends (like the Sukumon-related ones) which we might as well get out of the way now to simplify the last playthrough.

-----10/3:
Obtain the Legendary Sukumon from a hidden circle: eastern edge, just above path (prereq for friend #90). Note that this circle will not appear if you haven't finished the VN yet.
-----10/4:
Obtain friend #67 by clicking a hidden circle (south of the school).
-----10/6:
Choose "Follow Her" and "Save Her".
-----10/7:
Choose "Myself".
Save at choice. Obtain friend #59 by choosing "Braking".
Reload and choose "Breaking" to prevent Chihaya from showing up in the park on the 20th.
-----10/7 Mappie:
Porn book: 3rd floor, just left of center
Click on a hidden triangle: 3rd floor, second visit, just right of center (prereq for friend #84).
-----10/11 Mappie:
Obtain friend #84 from the hidden circle just SW of the right-hand stairs.
Obtain friend #92 from the hidden circle in the bottom left corner.
-----10/16:
If you haven't finished Quest #22: "Taste her plate" before, then save, choose "Go to the Cafeteria" to complete it, then reload.
Start Quest #26: "Say it with flowers" by choosing "Follow Kotori".
-----10/16 Mappie:
Plant three seeds: 1st floor, two places outside (NE shore of lake, SW of westernmost tree), 2nd floor (NW classroom)
-----10/17 Mappie:
Before choosing either Chihaya or Shizuru, plant three seeds: south of lake, most northeasterly blue building, postbox near west edge. Also, click on a hidden circle (southwest of that blue building) to obtain friend #65.
After choosing Chihaya, find various hidden circles: the park in the center (info #10 and friend #91), west side just under the higher yellow road (friend #66), green area at the bottom (requires friend #84, prereq for friends #85-90)
-----10/18:
Choose "Talk to Her".
Choose "It's Not a Big Deal" (to avoid Lucia route).
-----10/20:
Choose "Go".
If Chihaya doesn't come meet you in the park, you will be given info #6.
-----10/21 Mappie:
Plant one seed in the first alley: roof of 5th upper building from the left
Obtain friend #27 by choosing "Be Honest".
Plant two seeds in the second alley: roof of 6th upper building from the left, alley between 2nd and 3rd lower buildings from the right
-----10/23:
Choose "Follow Her".
-----10/24 Mappie:
Plant one seed in the fourth alley (after the dogs start chasing you): just under the upper building with stairs (that isn't right on the left edge)
-----10/25:
Save at the second choice.
Choose "Go Check on Shizuru" and control to the 26th to obtain friends #94 and #95.
Reload and choose "Listen to Kotori and Hurry Up" then "Follow Kotori" to get the Mappie segment.
-----10/25 Mappie:
Plant one seed. However, in order to actually plant the seed you must first collect several random items from other hidden circles. Oddly enough, not all of the relevant circles can be found right away, so the order matters a little.
- Click a hidden circle near the bottom just west of the vertical yellow street to get a boomerang.
- Click a hidden circle just under the coffee shop two blocks NE of the yellow intersection to get a magnet.
- Click a hidden circle on the west side of a blue building directly north of the objective to get a cardboard nikuman.
- Click a hidden circle next to a postbox near the NW corner to get an alligator clip.
- Click a hidden circle just SE of the yellow intersection to get an AA battery.
- Click a hidden circle on the sideways L-shaped green patch northeast of the objective. Click a second time to use these items and plant the seed.
Obtain friend #64 by clicking on a hidden circle (top left corner, just under the coffee place).
Porn books: east side between all the blue buildings, west side south of the road west of the hospital, top right corner
After the Mappie segment you will automatically send Inoue a report on the cat that can see ghosts (part of Quest #24: "Seeker of the Truth").
-----10/30:
Choose Quest #6: "Mysterious Building in Town - Rumored Ghost Activity". During Quest #6, find a porn book and friend #107: bottom left corner of big room, 1st floor
-----11/1:
If you planted all the seeds, Quest #26: "Say it with flowers" is completed after talking to Kotori.
-----11/6 Mappie:
Porn book: just under the first horizontal portion of the path. This should complete Quest #23: "Erohim bless you".
Obtain friends #85, #86, #87, #88, #89 and #90 from a series of five hidden circles, each of which is on the path.

Playthrough 4

Now we're going to try and get every single remaining quest and friend all in one playthrough (though there will be a lot of reloading). Make sure you do every single one of the following steps, even if you already have that particular friend/quest, because quite a few of them are prerequisites for others. It's easier to just do everything rather than try and work out which parts you can get away with not doing.

Most of the remaining quests involve finding "info" then investigating it, and some of these investigation opportunities only appear for Akane, so we'll have to go down her route (this is why playthroughs 3 and 4 can't really be combined). There is exactly one detail with regards to which playthrough 3 is required for playthrough 4 to work: if you've never read to end of Oct 25th after choosing "Follow Kotori", you're missing part of Quest #24: "Seeker of the Truth".

-----10/5:
Obtain info #3 and friends #53, #54, #55, #56 and #57 by choosing "Recruit Members" on Oct 5th.
-----10/6:
Choose "It Doesn't Matter" so that Chihaya won't come to the park on 10/20.

-----10/15:
You will automatically receive info #13 if you sent Inoue reports on quests #1 and #18.
-----10/16:
Choose "Go Somewhere Else".

-----10/17 Mappie:
After choosing Chihaya, click a hidden circle in the park in the center (info #10 and friend #91).
-----10/20:
If Chihaya doesn't come meet you in the park, you will be given info #6.
-----10/21:
Save at the second choice. Complete Quest #9: "I Actually Do Have Superpowers", reload, complete Quest #10: "I'm the One Who Really Does Have Superpowers", reload, then complete Quest #13: "Doll User". It is important that you do Quest #13: "Doll User" last.

Friend #97 comes with Quest #4, and friend #83 comes with Quest #5.
Quests #4 and #7 are also part of Quest #24: "Seeker of the Truth".
-----11/2:
Save at the choice and complete Quests #14, #15, #16, #17 and #20 (Wonders #1, #2, #3, #4 and #7) by reloading. Do Quest #14: Wonder #1 - "Entrance to an Alternate Dimension" last.

Choose Quest #21: Wonder #8 - "???". This is the last part of Quest #24: "Seeker of the Truth", so you should complete that as well.

These cannot all be done in a single continuous playthrough, so you don't need to worry about trying to do that. Also, all the Japanese walkthroughs I saw had either more or fewer conditions than this, but my own testing implies this list is more accurate.
