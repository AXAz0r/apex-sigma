Bad Ends:
 BAD END 1 has two variations. One outside, another inside the apartment.
 BAD END 2 has four variations. One with Tomoyo, one by yourself, one with Kanako, and another with Takafumi

  -I'll search for her*
   If you don't choose this you won't get choice 4, leading to a bad end.

  -Endure it silently*
   If you don't do this, choice 15 will invariably lead to a bad end later on.

  -Go to where the fireworks are*
   If you don't choose this you won't get choice 9, leading to a bad end.

  -Substitute for Tomoyo*
   If you don't choose this you won't get choice 10, leading to a bad end.

  -No way*
   If you don't choose this you won't get choice 15, leading to a bad end.

  -Sub in for Kanako*
   Succeeding at this will make choice 18 work.

  -Your Choice*
   Find another way will skip choice 17

  -Listen to her advice*
   Ignoring will lead to BAD END 1

  -Keep trying*
   Giving up will lead to BAD END 1.1 (same text, different location)

  -Tomoyo, Kanako and I*
   Choosing any other combination will skip choice 22, leading to BAD END 2 (with variations depending on who you're with)

  -Build a school*
   Think of possible alternatives will lead to BAD END 2 (Always by yourself version)

  -Refuse it*
   Succumbing to sexual temptations will always lead to bad ends, as it should.
