# Sigma - The API Giant Discord bot
#### Designed to bring knowledge to it's users!

> **Sigma** was initially designed and made to connect to as many API endpoints as we can get access to. It started with a planned 50 APIs, and more kept stacking out of nowhere. Soon, we were adding moderator commands, utilities, mini-games and music. Started work on an interactive web panel and more ideas are pouring in!

#### Sigma's current module groups are:
* **Games** - Game profiles and searches related to popular games.
* **Joke** - Modules made to make you laugh... That's a lie, you'll mostly cringe.
* **Minigames** - The small and fun things like coin flipping, rock-paper-scissors and slots.
* **Misc** - Stuff we couldn't sort into a category.
* **Moderation** - Full server control, soft bans, role manipulation, automated functions controls, etc.
* **Music** - Playing music in a voice channel, naturally.
* **Nihongo** - Features related to learning Japanese, like Jisho and WaniKani.
* **NSFW** - I doubt this module needs explanation. In a nutshell, it's explicit content.
* **Searches** - All sorts of neat search commands to get you stuff you need, from Wikipedia to Recipes.
* **Utility** - Modules to get quick info on a user or server, show a color hex, someone's avatar, and the such.
